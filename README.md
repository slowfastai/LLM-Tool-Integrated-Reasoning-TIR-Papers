# 🔧 LLM-Tool-Integrated-Reasoning-TIR-Papers

A curated collection of papers on **Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR)** — a rapidly evolving research direction where Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with **external tools** such as calculators, search engines, code interpreters, and web APIs to enhance reasoning, decision-making, and factual accuracy.

> 🧠 "The ability to use tools is what sets humans apart from other animals."  
> 🤖 Likewise, **the ability to use tools is what transforms an LLM into an agent.**

TIR marks a critical milestone in the evolution of LLMs: it extends models beyond static parametric knowledge, enabling them to dynamically interact with the external world via:
- 🖥️ Python interpreters  
- 🔍 Search engines  
- 🧮 Calculators  
- 🌐 Web APIs
